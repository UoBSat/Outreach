Install a little software that emulates thermapp as a vl42 device:

$ sudo apt install libusb-dev
$ sudo apt install v4l2loopback-dkms
$ git clone https://github.com/encryptededdy/ThermAppCam.git
$ cd ThermAppCam/thermapp

Here, the makefile is setup for older versions of cmake which like the libraries linked before the file name, but newer versions are unable to find libusb and similar libraries this way. So our best bet is to write the gcc commands ourselves since there are only 3 files instead of wasting time otherwise.

$ gcc -Wall -c -o thermapp.o thermapp.c -I/usr/include/libusb-1.0 -lpthread
$ gcc thermapp.o main.o   -o thermapp -lusb-1.0 -lpthread

Now when you do make, it should say thermapp is already setup or similar.
Next:
$ sudo make install

Now, whenever you want to read from the thermapp, first connect, keep cap on, then:
$ sudo thermapp

Then it can be used as an ordinary webcam with OpenCV. There will be a script to automate this and launch...somewhere....
